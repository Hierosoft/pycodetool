# PythonCodeTranslators
Code conversion tools, mostly just for removing dependencies so far.


## Features
### Python parsing
* Export a list of all global identifiers (after pre-processing on
  load).

### Commands
Installing the module (or installing linux-preinstall and adding
linux-preinstall/utilities and linux-preinstall/utilities-developer) to
the PATH) provides the following commands:
- `changes`: Look for repos in the current directory and show what
  changes are not yet committed (including untracked).
- `ggrep`: Get a geany command to go to the line in the file from grep
  (searching within file(s)). Recursively search directories by default.

### Python.NET to standard Python (framework_to_standard_python):
Note that GUI conversion is not tested or supported, but you can try it
the manually implement whatever is missing (or use IronPython as
necessary and not use PythonCodeTranslators).

#### STEP 1
For now, you must use SharpDevelop 4.4.
- Why: The snippet converter isn't online anymore--only a stripped down open source one is there and it only converts between C# and VB.NET. See <https://github.com/icsharpcode/CodeConverter/issues/709>.

1. Open the project in SharpDevelop (4.4 is tested). If you can't open the project, merely create a new project and add all of the C# files first.
2. Click "Project" (in the Menu bar at the top), "Convert", "From C# to Python"

#### STEP 2
This step (and this project) is only necessary if you have some sort of IronPython code (such as created using SharpDevelop's C# to Python converter).

`python_remove_dotnet.py` removes non-standard Python as follows:
* Eliminates various issues and .NET calls such as introduced by SharpDevelop's C# to Python translation (formerly available in icsharpcode snippet converter)
* Removes "from System" imports
* Removes "Exception" and uses traceback instead of an exception object
* Changes "Substring" to slice notation (converts count to end)
* Fixes issue with icsharpcode snippet converter using ArrayList and forgetting it renamed it starting with `_`
* Changes ArrayList iteration to list iteration
* Comments duplicate methods (and shows warning during parsing)
* Changes Console.Error.Write to sys.stdout.write (and ALWAYS prepends 'import sys' if not already present)
* Changes Console.WriteLine to print
* Changes Console.Error.WriteLine to sys.stderr.write, write("\n"), flush()
* Changes something.ToString() to str(something)
* Add 'pass' where icsharpcode converter issue leaves no indented area under 'except' or 'finally'
* Parse StreamReader (local) usage, changing 'while' to 'for', making temp variable for ReadLine and then putting temp.rstrip() into the programmer's variable
* Parse StreamWriter (scope not yet checked) changing `WriteLine(something)` to `write(something+"\n")`
* Change '.Trim()' to '.strip()'


## Changes
See changelog.md.


## Known Issues
See also https://github.com/poikilos/PythonCodeTranslators/issues
* (wontfix) (This is not possible to fix) Correct icsharpcode snippet converter issue where even public member variables have underscore prefix (which denotes private in python)
